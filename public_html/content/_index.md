Thanks for visiting this site, a personal blog about knowledge graphs. Here I explore graph algorithms applied to various databases such as [KuzuDB](https://kuzudb.com), [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com) or [memgraph](https://memgraph.com). There's a bit of Python thrown in here but the code base is largely Rust. 

This project is for my own edification: I hope to learn about the many fascinating ways graph algorithms are used to solve problems.
